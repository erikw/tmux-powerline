# But I decided that I don't want any info about songs if there is nothing playing. Unfortunately I did not find a way of expressing this with mpc (I'm sure there is with idle/idleloop) but I did found a useful library: libmpdclient. I've used version 2.7 when developing my small program. Download the latest version here: http://sourceforge.net/projects/musicpd/files/libmpdclient/
