# Print the currently used keyboard layout
# This depends on a specifically developed program which prints the group id of
# the currently used layout.
# I developed the simple program myself with some guidance as I was unable to
# find anything already developed.
# Some people might suggest:
# $ setxkbmod -query -v | awk -F "+" '{print $2}'
# this will only work if you have set up XKB with a single layout which is true
# for some.

# This script will print the correct layout even if layout is set per window.
# Exit if platform is not linux as this script is dependant on X11
