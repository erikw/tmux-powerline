# tmux-powerline
This is a set of scripts (segments) for making a nice and dynamic tmux statusbar where elements can come and disappears depending on events. I really like the look of [Lokaltog/vim-powerline](https://github.com/Lokaltog/vim-powerline) and I decided I wanted the same for tmux.

The following segments exists for now:
* LAN & WAN IP addresses.
* Now Playing for MPD, Spotify (GNU/Linux native or wine, OS X), iTunes (OS X), Rhythmbox, Banshee, MOC, Audacious, Rdio (OS X), cmus and Last.fm (last scrobbled track).
* New mail count for GMail, Maildir, mbox and Apple Mail.
* GNU/Linux and Macintosh OS X battery status (uses [richo/dotfiles/bin/battery](https://github.com/richoH/dotfiles/blob/master/bin/battery)).
* Weather in Celsius, Fahrenheit and Kelvin using Yahoo Weather.
* System load, cpu usage and uptime.
* Git, SVN and Mercurial branch in CWD.
* Date and time.
* Hostname.
* tmux info.
* CWD in pane.
* Current X keyboard layout.
* Network download/upload speed.

New mails, now playing, average load, weather, date and time.

Now I've read my inbox so the mail segment disappears!

![right-status, no mail](https://github.com/erikw/tmux-powerline/raw/master/img/right-status_no_mail.png)

After pausing the music there's no need for showing NP anymore. Also the weather has become much nicer!

Remaining battery.

# Requirements
Requirements for the lib to work are:

* Recent tmux version
* `bash --version` >= 4.0
* A patched font. Follow instructions at [Lokaltog/vim-powerline/fontpatcher](https://github.com/Lokaltog/vim-powerline/tree/develop/fontpatcher) or [download](https://github.com/Lokaltog/vim-powerline/wiki/Patched-fonts) a new one. However you can use other substitute symbols as well; see `config.sh`.

## Segment Requirements
Requirements for some segments. You only need to fullfill the requirements for those segments you want to use.

* wan_ip.sh, np_lastfm.sh, weather_yahoo.sh: curl, bc
* np_mpd.sh: [libmpdclient](http://sourceforge.net/projects/musicpd/files/libmpdclient/)
* xkb_layout.sh: X11, XKB
* mail_count_gmail.sh: wget.
* ifstat.sh: ifstat (there is a simpler segment not using ifstat but samples /sys/class/net)
* tmux_mem_cpu_load.sh: [tmux-mem-cpu-load](https://github.com/thewtex/tmux-mem-cpu-load)

## OS X specific requirements

**You still need to follow the first part of these instructions even if you are running zsh or something else as your default shell!**

tmux-powerline uses associative arrays in bash, which were added in bash version 4.0. OS X Lion ships with an antiquated version of bash ( run
`bash --version` to see your version). In order to use tmux-powerline, you need to install a newer version of bash, fortunately,
[brew](http://mxcl.github.com/homebrew/) makes this very easy. If you don't have brew, [install it](https://github.com/mxcl/homebrew/wiki/installation).
Then follow these steps:

```bash
$ brew install bash
```

**If you're using something other than bash (or if you don't want this newer version of bash as your default shell) you should be done now**. If something
seems broken, try following the last two steps and see if it helps:

```bash
$ sudo bash -c "echo /usr/local/Cellar/bash/%INSTALLED_VERSION%/bin/bash >> /private/etc/shells"
$ chsh -s /usr/local/Cellar/bash/%INSTALLED_VERSION%/bin/bash
```

The first command installs bash through brew, the second registers the new shell with the system and the third changes to the new shell for your user.
If you later upgrade bash through brew, don't forget to do the last two steps again with the new version number. After doing the above and restarting your
terminal, running `echo $SHELL` should result in the following:

```bash
$ echo $SHELL
/usr/local/Cellar/bash/%INSTALLED_VERSION%/bin/bash
```

The `grep` tool is outdatted on OS X 10.8 Mountain Lion so you might have to upgrade it. Unfortunately the main homebrew repo 
[does not contain grep](https://github.com/mxcl/homebrew/pull/3473) so use the following command to get the lastest version.

```bash
brew install https://raw.github.com/Homebrew/homebrew-dupes/master/grep.rb
```

# Installation
Just check out the repository with:

```console
$ cd ~/some/path/
$ git clone git://github.com/erikw/tmux-powerline.git
```

Now edit your `~/.tmux.conf` to use the scripts:

<!-- Close syntax enought. -->
```vim
set-option -g status on
set-option -g status-interval 2
set-option -g status-utf8 on
set-option -g status-justify "centre"
set-option -g status-left-length 60
set-option -g status-right-length 90
set-option -g status-left "#(~/path/to/tmux-powerline/status-left.sh)"
set-option -g status-right "#(~/path/to/tmux-powerline/status-right.sh)"
```

Set the maximum lengths to something that suits your configuration of segments and size of terminal (the maximum segments length will be handled better in the future). Segments needs to use different tools or options depending on platform. Currently there is only a distinction between Linux systems and OS X systems. `config.sh` tries to detect what machine your're on with `uname`. If needed you can override this setting with the PLATFORM variable there (or wherever you want to define it).


Also I recommend you to use the [tmux-colors-solarized](https://github.com/seebi/tmux-colors-solarized) theme (as well as solarized for [everything else](http://ethanschoonover.com/solarized) :)):

```bash
source ~/path/to/tmux-colors-solarized/tmuxcolors.conf
```
Some segments e.g. cwd and cvs_branch needs to find the current working directory of the active pane. To achive this we let tmux save the path each time the shell prompt is displayed. Put the line below in your `~/.bashrc` or where you define you PS1 variable. zsh users can put it in e.g. `~/.zshrc` and may change `PS1` to `PROMPT` (but that's not necessary).

```bash
PS1="$PS1"'$([ -n "$TMUX" ] && tmux setenv TMUXPWD_$(tmux display -p "#D" | tr -d %) "$PWD")'
```

You can toggle the visibility of the statusbars by adding the following to your `~/.tmux.conf`:

```vim
bind C-[ run '~/path/to/tmux-powerline/mute_statusbar.sh left'		# Mute left statusbar.
bind C-] run '~/path/to/tmux-powerline/mute_statusbar.sh right'		# Mute right statusbar.
```

# Configuration

Edit the two status scripts to suit you needs. A number of common segments are included that covers some general functions like time, date, battery etc. The segments can be moved around and does not needs to be in the order (or same file) as they are now. It should be quite easy to add you own segments.

```console
$ $EDITOR ~/path/to/tmux-powerline/status-left.sh
$ $EDITOR ~/path/to/tmux-powerline/status-right.sh
```


Here is one segment configuration explained so you'll know how to make you own.

```bash
declare -A time 								# The name of the array.
time+=(["script"]="${segments_path}/time.sh")	# mandatory, the shell script producing the output text to be shown.
time+=(["foreground"]="colour136")				# mandatory, the text foreground color.
time+=(["background"]="colour235")				# mandatory, the text background color.
time+=(["separator"]="${separator_left_thin}")	# mandatory, the separator to use. Can be (as described in `lib.sh`) any of separator_(left|right)_(bold|thin)
time+=(["separator_fg"]="default")				# optional, overrides the default blending coloring of the separator with a custom colored foreground.
register_segment "time"							# Registers the name of the array declared above.
```
# Debugging

Some segments might not work on your system for various reasons such as missing programs or different versions not having the same options. If a segment fails the printing should be aborted. To investigate further why a segment fails you can run

```bash
$ bash -x ~/path/to/failing/segment.sh
```
To see all output even if some segment fails you can set `DEBUG_MODE="true"` in `config.sh`.

## Common problems

### VCS_branch is not updating
The issue is probably that the update of the current directory in the active pane is not updated correctly. Make sure that your PS1 or PROMPT variable actually contains the line from the installation step above by simply inspecing the output of `echo $PS1`. You might have placed the PS1 line in you shell confugration such that it is overwritten later. The simplest solution is to put it at the very end to make sure that nothing overwrites it. See [issue #52](https://github.com/erikw/tmux-powerline/issues/52).
